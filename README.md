Akeyless is a unified platform designed to secure credentials and access to various resources across hybrid cloud and legacy environments. It offers two main functionalities:

Akeyless Vault for Secrets Management: This component acts as a secure vault to protect and manage secrets like API keys, credentials, tokens, and keys used by DevOps tools and cloud platforms. It centralizes these secrets and provides controlled access to them.

Secure Remote Access: This feature enables secure access to any system from any location based on user identity. It strengthens infrastructure and application security by offering features like unified authentication and ephemeral just-in-time access permissions.

Akeyless stands out for its security measures. It utilizes a patented technology called Distributed Fragment Cryptography (DFC) which ensures that encryption keys are never stored entirely or in the hands of a single party. This eliminates the need to trust the service provider with your keys, enhancing overall security.
